# My Name is Andy Futuro

Hi, Iâ€™m Andy. I am a professional ghostwriter and novelist based out of Philadelphia. I am the author of No Dogs in Philly, Cloud Country, and Josephine Wins Again, available wherever books are sold.

In addition to writing books, I compose electronic music. I have synesthesia, which allows me to "see" sounds as colorful three-dimensional objects. My music is an attempt to arrange these sounds in complex, surprising, and beautiful patterns. 

I lead a simple, practical life of love and friendship, outdoor exploration, creative expression, and social justice activism. I am an Appalachian Trail and Pacific Crest Trail thru-hiker. My motto is "courage and kindness." I have seen the northern lights and climbed mountains under stars.
